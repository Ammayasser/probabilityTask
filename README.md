1- nCr = 250!/(2!(250-2)!) = 31,125
2- nCr = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10
3- 2^3 = 8 
4- nCr = 30! /(3!(30-3) = 4060
5- nCr = 6! /( 3!(6-3) = 20 
6- The probability that at least one of the three tries you roll is 91/216
7- a) nCr = 4! /(3!(4-3)!) = 4 
   b) nCr = 5! / (3!(4-2)!) = 10
       Total = 4+ 10*2 = 24
8- a) nCr = 25! /(14!(25-14)!) = 4457400
